# Bridge Version

The version module allows you to display version info in the server console, this works for both the bridge and scripts using the bridge by simply including a `github` metadata entry.

```lua
name 'reFlow-Bridge'
author 'reFlow'
version '1.0.0'
description 'reFlow Bridge - reflow-store.com'
github 'https://github.com/reFlowStore/versions'
```

The version module will look for the `name` metadata entry in the fxmanifest and look for that file to compare version number and get the changelog.

You can store all resource version info under one single repo with creating a file `YourScriptName.json` with the contents of the example below.

```json filename="reFlow-Bridge.json" copy
{
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "changelog": [
        "Uploaded Version File",
        "Increased Version Number To v1.0.1"
    ]
}
```
